# Go Sample Example - Closing Resources with Defer

This repository demonstrates how to use `defer` in Go to ensure that resources, such as files, are properly closed after use. It highlights the importance of deferring cleanup actions, such as closing files, to avoid resource leaks, even when an error occurs.

## üìñ Information

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>This example covers the usage of `defer` to manage resource cleanup in Go.</li>
  <li>The `defer` statement ensures that the file is closed properly after it is no longer needed, even if the program encounters an error.</li>
  <li>This example demonstrates a basic use case of opening and closing a file, with error handling for file operations.</li>
</ul>

## üíª Code Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {

	// This example demonstrates using defer to ensure resources like files are closed properly, even if an error occurs

	file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	fmt.Println("File opened successfully")
	// Processing file content...
}
```
