# Go Sample Example - Defer with HTTP Requests

This repository demonstrates how to use `defer` in Go to manage resources when making HTTP requests. It shows how `defer` can be used to ensure that resources like HTTP response bodies are closed properly after use.

## üìñ Information

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>This example covers the usage of `defer` to handle resource cleanup in HTTP requests.</li>
  <li>It highlights how to use `defer` to close the HTTP response body, ensuring that resources are released even if an error occurs during the request or response processing.</li>
  <li>This example involves making an HTTP GET request and reading the response body.</li>
</ul>

## üíª Code Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {

	// using defer to close the response body of an HTTP request

	resp, err := http.Get("https://www.google.com")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	body, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(string(body))
}
```
